## Ambassador Scheme update

Launched on stage at GraphQL Conf

We have 19 enthusiastic ambassadors, with 10 further applications to be reviewed
in November

1st set of onboarding calls has happened with lots of new ideas already emerging

## Google Summer of Code

Should we incorporate a project for Google Summer of Code? \
Vanessa’s project was about embedding accessibility into GraphQL

A yearly cycle, projects are announced in Spring

Contributors to the project are students or anyone new to open source

One of the aspects is regular mentoring sessions

We should see if we can get some commitment from potential mentors and go from
there

Vanessa & Martin as potential mentors

Jeff can liaise with the GraphQL Board for legal matters

Draft email to board:

_In the September 2025 meeting of the Community WG, Vanessa Johnson (New York
Times, GraphQLConf speaker) suggested that GraphQL participate in Google Summer
of Code (GSoC) 2026. Apparently we did this in 2020 and there's been some
discussion about doing it again here. With the Board's approval, we'd like to
put out a call for volunteers to mentor GSoC participants and put together
projects. Vanessa has already raised her hand to serve in this capacity. It
seems highly aligned with the Foundation’s mission but if anyone has any
concerns please feel free to reply! We expect that there will need to be
sign-off from the Foundation at some point in the process. We can add this as a
discussion item in the next Board meeting._

## Other Business

- For feedback on the Guild platform you can Slack Taz questions, or email
- The landing page of the website is done, but designs on other pages are being
  worked on eg the Learn pages, Community pages, etc
- How do we want to organize the conference videos on the website? As at the
  moment it is all just under the conference schedule
- Guild platform APIs - Taz is happy to work with the Foundation to build an API
  for Guild events to expose to the website. This can also mirror Meetup events.
- [GraphQL.org](GraphQL.org) events page - Benjie & Jem updated it for the
  Conference, removing outdated events etc, but being able to synchronise events
  in the future would be great; along with showing videos and photos
