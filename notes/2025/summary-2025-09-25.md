## Summary

### GraphQL Day at API Days Paris

The September Community Working Group meeting began with introductions from Benjie, Martin, Jem, Vanessa, and Uri. Martin confirmed that Jonathan Rayner and Janet would not be attending. The group discussed the GraphQL Day at API Days Paris, which Martin presented as a three-day event in Paris on December 9-11, with GraphQL content scheduled for December 11. Martin noted that the GraphQL room would be smaller and more intimate than in previous years, with a capacity of 100-150 people.

### GraphQL Day Event Planning Discussion

The team discussed organizing a GraphQL day event hosted by API Day, with Martin explaining that the community event will take place in a room provided by API Day and offering free tickets to contributors. They discussed the CFP process, with Martin noting that a team of volunteers is needed to review submissions, and Benjie emphasizing the importance of a streamlined process to finalize talks within a few weeks. Jem introduced the topic of FOSDEM, a major open-source conference in Brussels, and asked if the team wants to organize another Dev Room track focused on GraphQL and related technologies, with a submission deadline in October.

### FOSDEM Event Application Planning

The team discussed organizing an event application for FOSDEM, a community-oriented open-source conference, with a deadline on October 12th. Jem highlighted the importance of having a strong team to champion the application process, noting that previous experiences at the event have increased awareness of GraphQL. Benjie described FOSDEM as a unique event with a large number of attendees, emphasizing its interactive format with classroom-style talks and booths for project representation. The team agreed on the need to submit an application soon to participate in the event.

### FOSDEM 2024 Planning and Ambassadors

The group discussed plans for FOSDEM 2024, with Benjie proposing a minimal-effort booth option versus a more resource-intensive dev room or combined booth/table setup. Jem reported on the successful launch of the ambassador program, which now has 19 ambassadors and is receiving new applications for December review. Vanessa presented an idea for a Google Summer of Code project focused on embedding accessibility information into GraphQL, building on her own previous experience with the program.

### Google Summer of Code Planning
