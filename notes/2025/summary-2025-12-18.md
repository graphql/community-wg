## Summary

### GraphQL Community Working Group Meeting

The GraphQL Community Working Group meeting began with introductions from members including Viola from WonderGraph, Dev from WonderGraph, Pascal from ChilliCream, and Jen who manages the GraphQL Foundation's Ambassador program. Martin, who organized the meeting, noted that the scheduled participants Michael and Benjie were unable to attend due to a board meeting conflict, though Pascal was present. The group discussed the social media guide that Michael had developed for managing the organization's YouTube, Twitter, Blue Sky, and LinkedIn channels, emphasizing vendor-neutrality and avoiding clickbait content. The meeting also included a planned presentation about the resource hub page from Piotr, though the transcript ended before this discussion could take place.

### GraphQL Advocacy and Community Growth

The group discussed plans for improving GraphQL's public perception and advocacy efforts in 2026, with Martin highlighting recent negative articles about GraphQL and suggesting a need for better reference materials and positive content. Viola offered to connect the team with her post-sale customers who could provide platform-agnostic GraphQL case studies, while Jemgillam noted that previous case study collection efforts needed to be revived. The team also reviewed the recent GraphQL Day event, which was organized by the community and hosted by API Days, attracting 25-35 attendees for 11 sessions, though Martin expressed some concerns about attendance and suggested ways to improve future events.

### GraphQL Conference Attendance Challenges

The team discussed challenges with the GraphQL conference, particularly low attendance for the API Days track due to its timing at the end of the event and competition from multiple concurrent sessions across 10 different tracks. They identified that having too many simultaneous sessions reduces attendance and agreed to consider fewer concurrent tracks in future events. Piotr noted that while the website development process was quick, they could improve by having more clarity about the conference's status (whether it would be hosted by the GraphQL Foundation) earlier in the planning process.

### GraphQL Conference Strategy Discussion

The team discussed their experience at a recent conference, where Martin noted meaningful interactions at the GraphQL booth but expressed concerns about the empty rooms and low attendance for GraphQL-specific sessions. Pascal suggested considering a separate GraphQL booth in the future to make a stronger impact, while Martin highlighted the value of collaborating with other communities like OpenAPI. They agreed to ask for a larger space and to be placed near other communities next time, balancing the need to stand out with the benefits of collaboration.

### Resource Hub Navigation Updates

Piotr presented the new Resource Hub page, which includes subcategories for tools and libraries, videos, and reading resources. He invited feedback and suggested improvements to better reflect the current GraphQL ecosystem. Viola pointed out a broken link on the current site. Piotr explained the navigation changes and the process for contributing to the resource hub. The team discussed the implementation of the resource hub in the repository, making it easy for contributors to add new resources via pull requests.

### GraphQL Content and Community Updates

The team discussed maintaining and curating content for GraphQL.org, agreeing that while the community could help, some manual curation would be necessary. Piotr is working on a GitHub issue template and script to streamline the process, with Martin offering to review the pull request. They also touched on the GraphQL Conference 2026, which is still in the planning stages with potential venues being considered for a spring event. Jem Gillam provided an update on the Ambassador program, announcing 12 new ambassadors from various regions who are already contributing to the GraphQL community.

### Ambassador Travel and Import Challenges

The team discussed travel budget and expenses for ambassadors attending GraphQL conferences, noting that expenses can be covered for conference-related travel. They identified challenges with sending ambassador merchandise due to new import taxes in the US and some European countries, which have increased fees significantly. Jemgillam mentioned exploring dropshipping companies as a potential solution to avoid high import fees for ambassador swag. The next meeting was scheduled for mid-January, with the team encouraged to stay connected via Discord in the meantime.
