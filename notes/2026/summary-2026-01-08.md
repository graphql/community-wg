## Summary

### GraphQL Working Group Meeting Setup

The GraphQL Community Working Group meeting began with introductions and a discussion about adding participants to the agenda. Jean mentioned committing changes to add his name, which automatically generated a commit message. Jem noted that some attendees were still missing, including Regin and Eric. Martin offered to host the meeting, but Jem agreed to take on the role. Jem explained the meeting's structure, including the use of YouTube for publishing and AI summary tools. The group agreed to start with introductions, beginning with Martin.

### GraphQL Weekly Revival Discussion

The meeting began with introductions from Martin, Erik, Jem, and Jean, who discussed their roles and affiliations. Martin then shared several announcements, including the revival of GraphQL Weekly, which Piotr is rewriting and open-sourcing. He encouraged participants to contribute content to help restart the newsletter. The group also briefly discussed the transition of the Viaduct project from Airbnb to becoming public.

### GraphQL TV Channel Growth Strategy

The team discussed social media strategy, particularly focusing on YouTube and GraphQL TV channel growth. Michael from ChiliCream has been successful in growing the GraphQL TV channel's subscriber base from around 200 to over 2,000 in recent months through targeted advertising and improved video thumbnails. The channel now releases two videos per week, with content scheduled through Typefully for both YouTube and social media posts. The team confirmed they have enough content to last until May, with the possibility of re-releasing older 2023 conference videos if needed.

### Automating Event Page Updates

The team discussed a new event page that was recently updated with WebGL features and filtering capabilities. Jem noted that while the page looks good, maintaining and updating it manually could be challenging, leading to a discussion about potentially integrating automatic APIs to pull event data from GraphQL Meetup groups. Erik suggested exploring options to automate the event listing process, whether through JSON files or other workflows, and the team agreed this would be a valuable improvement.

### Website PR Management and Events

The team discussed creating an issue in the website repository to manage pull requests for event data, with Erik suggesting manual review for now to avoid security concerns. Jem agreed to be responsible for reviewing pull requests, and they noted that while they track group information in a spreadsheet, individual event data still needs manual management. The team also addressed a typo in the Oslo meetup title for 2026 and discussed promoting it, as well as the importance of maintaining their LinkedIn presence for community engagement.

### Social Media Analytics Strategy

The team discussed analytics for their social media presence, noting a cumulative count of 123,000 across platforms. Erik suggested creating a content hub to improve visibility of cross-posted content, while Jem mentioned existing Slack channels for community leaders and Megaphone. Erik requested help getting back into the Slack community leaders channel after being removed, and Jem agreed to assist.

### GraphQL Community Collaboration Tools

The meeting focused on discussing collaboration tools for the GraphQL community. Jem and Erik explored options like Slack, Notion, and Obsidian for sharing ideas and links, with Jean suggesting Obsidian due to its file-based and Git-friendly nature. Martin mentioned a Buffer account as another potential tool. The group agreed to investigate both Notion and Obsidian further and create an issue to track progress. Martin also shared updates about the GraphQL Conference, scheduled for May 6-7, and discussed the possibility of participating in API Days New York. Jem mentioned plans to organize calls for new ambassadors and address logistics for ambassador hoodies.
