### The files in this folder

- **[Overview for Ambassadors](./overview-for-ambassadors.md)** - an overview of
  the proposed GraphQL Ambassador Program for the Ambassadors themselves, this
  document will become the basis of the webpage inviting the reader to the
  Ambassador application process.

- **[Overview for Organizers](./overview-for-organizers.md)** - an overview of
  the proposed GraphQL Ambassador Program for the organizers (the Foundation,
  community working group and other interested parties) outlining the goals,
  outcomes and tasks of the program.

- **[Standards of Excellence](./standards-of-excellence.md)** - the proposed
  Standards of Excellence which all Ambassadors will agree to. While the wider
  GraphQL community abides by the
  [contributor covenant code of conduct](https://graphql.org/codeofconduct/), a
  stronger set of standards is used for this program as the Foundation will be
  endorsing the Ambassadors as go-to community leaders.
