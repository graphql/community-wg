## GraphQL Ambassador Program

The following is the beginnings of a document outlining the goals, outcomes and tasks of an Ambassador program. 

### Alternative Names

* Champion - already used on the technical side - Champions of spec edits
* Evangelist - usually out of favour nowadays
* Advocate - suggests a salaried role?
* Leader, Star, Hero, Captain, Expert - “Star” we have already used in a recognition role
* GraphQL Fellowship 

> [!NOTE]
> “Ambassador” seems to be readily accepted, I don't think we need to discuss the term any further.   

### Ambassador Initiative Goals

The overarching goal is to increase GraphQL adoption. The Ambassadors program aims to accomplish this through:

* Brand advocacy - developers organically vouch for and promote GraphQL
* Social proof - named individuals with high visibility (and a proportion from known corporate brands) as Ambassadors
* Increased GraphQL content online and off
* Community building - increase the number of “known faces” within GraphQL, increased approachability (addressing the concern of “lowering the barrier to join an inclusive GraphQL community” raised by the Community WG)  

How can these goals be measured? 

* Engagement metrics - social, chat channels, search, downloads, page views…
* New community members (across social media comments, Discord users, local gathering attendees, working group members…) 
* Volume of talks at conferences
* Volume of articles written

### Ambassador Tasks

As a GraphQL Ambassador, you will be an important touchstone for people interested in GraphQL to learn more about it in a friendly and constructive way. 

One or more of the following:

* Conference & meetup talks on GraphQL
* Local gathering organization
* Written GraphQL content
* Video / audio GraphQL content

### Foundation Tasks

* Ambassadors may apply for travel funding to approved conference & meetup talks, applications to be evaluated on a case-by-case basis
* Microgrant (or honorarium) available for content creation 
    * Where is this content hosted? 
* Promotion of Ambassador material - conference talk videos and created content
* Promotion of the Ambassador as a go-to GraphQL expert
    * Website profile
    * Longer task: biographies / interviews with each Ambassador
    * Credly badge
* Exclusive GraphQL swag eg Ambassador hoodie

### Ambassador Requirements

* Highly knowledgeable about GraphQL and readily able to articulate those ideas 
* Technical in tone, without sounding like they are on a sales team
* Be a model community member: Adhering to the code of conduct especially when critical of GraphQL or defending it to others criticism, remaining respectful, constructive and fair 
* Do not come across to other community members as selling another product, service or agenda


### Ambassador Code of Conduct

While the wider GraphQL community abides by the [contributor covenant code of conduct](https://graphql.org/codeofconduct/), we will need a stronger set of standards for the Ambassador Program. This is because the Foundation will be endorsing these people as representatives. We can look to the [CNCF Ambassador Program Standards of Excellence](https://www.cncf.io/people/ambassadors/program-standards/) as a good indicator of what this should be. In fact, we are encouraged to borrow liberally from them, as they are also a Linux Foundation project with an already successful program, and their lawyers have already signed it off. 

### Process

Yearly program
 * 1 year term? Or mirror the TSC and use a 2 year term  

How many Ambassadors is a reasonable number?  

Self-nominations and nominations from within the community; who should review these?  

Process for removing an Ambassador? And the reason to do so?  

Content generated will need to be reviewed before being promoted  

Travel expenses for conferences & meetups: 
  * Wait for the talk to be accepted through the meetup CfP process  
  * Review the talk proposal to ensure alignment with the Program  
  * Can the payment be made beforehand rather than in arrears?
