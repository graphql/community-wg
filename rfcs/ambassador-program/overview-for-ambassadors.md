## GraphQL Ambassador Program

### Ambassador Code of Conduct

While the wider GraphQL community abides by the [contributor covenant code of conduct](https://graphql.org/codeofconduct/), a stronger set of standards is used for the Ambassador Program. This is because the Foundation endorses Ambassadors as representatives and leaders; the Standards of Excellence are designed to provide a set of guidelines and best practices for engaging with the GraphQL Foundation and broader community. This makes it easier for Ambassadors to contribute to a positive culture by providing clarity around what and how we create a safe and collaborative environment. See [standards-of-excellence.md](./standards-of-excellence.md)

### Application Process

Applications are open year-round and are received by a small panel of Foundation and TSC members. Once the Ambassadors program is fully up-and-running, Ambassadors will also have the option to review applications. The Ambassador term is a year long, Ambassadors who continue to meet the expectations will be invited to join again at the end of their term. 

Applications can be from the applicant themselves, or a nomination from another community member. 

A new wave of Ambassadors will be announced quarterly; we are aiming for the first announcement to coincide with the GraphQL Conference in September 2025.
