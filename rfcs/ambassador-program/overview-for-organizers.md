## GraphQL Ambassador Program

The following is an overview of the proposed GraphQL Ambassador Program for the organizers (the Foundation, community working group and other interested parties) outlining the goals, outcomes and tasks of the program.

### Ambassador Initiative Goals

The overarching goal is to increase GraphQL adoption. The Ambassador Program aims to accomplish this through:

* Brand advocacy - developers organically vouch for and promote GraphQL
* Social proof - named individuals with high visibility (and a proportion from known corporate brands) as Ambassadors
* Increased GraphQL content online and off
* Community building - increasing the number of “known faces” within GraphQL, increased approachability and a welcoming environment to spread knowledge about GraphQL  

There are also benefits to the Ambassador: 

* Professional recognition as a GraphQL expert  
* Access to other GraphQL experts, both in their local community and online
* Closer relationship with the GraphQL Foundation & project, including up-to-date news and insights on upcoming Specification edits and working group topics 

### Ambassador Requirements

* Highly knowledgeable about GraphQL and readily able to articulate those ideas 
* Be a model community member: Adhering to the standards of excellence especially when critical of GraphQL or defending it to others criticism, remaining respectful, constructive and fair 
* Do not come across to other community members as selling another product, service or agenda when acting as an ambassador
* Already participating in one or more of the Ambassador Tasks outlined below
* Agree to have their face, name, chosen socials and other relevant information displayed on the "people"/"ambassadors" page

### Ambassador Tasks

GraphQL Ambassadors will be an important touchstone for people interested in GraphQL to learn more about it in a friendly and constructive way. 

They will do four or more ambassador tasks throughout their one year term. They can do the same task four times, or a mixture of tasks.

Ambassador tasks include:

    * 15 minute presentation-style  
    * followed by Q&A  
    * time also allowed for the Foundation / TSC reps to ask for the Ambassadors' feedback on the current directions of the GraphQL project, be that technical (eg Specification RFCs), or community initative focused 
* Promotion of the Ambassador as a go-to GraphQL community leader
    * Website profile
    * Biographies / interviews with each Ambassador
    * Credly badge
* An Ambassador role on the community Discord and an associated private channel for networking and discussions with Foundation / TSC / community reps

* Exclusive GraphQL swag eg Ambassador hoodie
* Free GraphQL Foundation Conference ticket
* Ambassadors may apply for travel funding to approved conference & meetup talks, applications to be evaluated on a case-by-case basis
* An honorarium available for content creation on a case-by-case basis

### Ambassador Standards of Excellence

While the wider GraphQL community abides by the [contributor covenant code of conduct](https://graphql.org/codeofconduct/), stronger set of standards is needed for the Ambassador Program. This is because the Foundation will be endorsing these people as representatives and experts. We can look to the [CNCF Ambassador Program Standards of Excellence](https://www.cncf.io/people/ambassadors/program-standards/) as a good indicator of what this should be. The beginnings of a document is here, see [standards-of-excellence.md](./standards-of-excellence.md)

### Process

#### Application Process

Yearly program
 * 1 year term 
    * Applications open year round
    * Applications received by a group email address and should be acknowledged swiftly
    * Applications to be considered by TSC members, select Foundation members and select community working group members. Once we have the first cohort of Ambassadors accepted, Ambassadors themselves can also consider the applications.  
    * Applicants need at least one approval, any objections are to be investigated.
    * A new wave of Ambassadors announced quarterly. The first announcement we are hoping can coincide with the GraphQL Conference in September 2025.  

* Applications can be from the prospective Ambassador or a nomination from a community member. 
* Foundation members will be asked to nominate an Ambassador from within their organization, and to nominate a second Ambassador from outside their organization
* TSC members will be invited to apply when they are welcomed to the TSC  
* The Ambassador term is a year long, Ambassadors who continue to meet the expectations will be invited to join again at the end of their term

#### Removal of an Ambassador

* The Ambassador term is a year long, this gives a natural end to a person's Ambassador role
* If the Ambassador is found to be breaking the [standards-of-excellence.md](./standards-of-excellence.md), the GraphQL Code of Conduct or the Linux Foundation Events Code of Conduct, the Ambassador role may be removed before the end of their term. The Ambassador Program organizers will engage with the Linux Foundation for this process as needed.  

#### Travel expenses

* Wait for the talk to be accepted through the meetup CfP process  
* Review the talk proposal to ensure alignment with the Program  
* Can the payment be made beforehand rather than in arrears?   

#### Honorarium for content creation

* Ambassador applies for an honorarium each time, in a process similar to the Community Grant
* There will be a maximum yearly amount available, paid from the Marketing budget 
* We should publish a guide to the amounts available (once this is agreed)
* A revision process is expected

### Offboarding and Alumni Network

Upon completing a successful term, Ambassadors join our Alumni Network:
* Continued Ambassador Discord channel to answer questions from new Ambassadors.
* Priority CFP notifications for GraphQL Foundation events
* Annual Alumni spotlight blog series
* What else to include here?
