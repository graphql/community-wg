# GraphQL Social Media

GraphQL is present on:

- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/graphql)
- [BlueSky](https://bsky.app/profile/graphql.org)
- [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/graphql-foundation/)
- [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@GraphQLTV)

The community manages the publications through [Typefully](https://typefully.com/) (with a current experimentation with [Buffer](https://buffer.com/)).

## Contributing 

If you want to contribute content, please feel free to share ideas and links in the `#community-wg` channel on the [GraphQL Community Discord](https://discord.graphql.org), or the `#social-media` Slack channel. (The Discord is free to join. To join the Slack channel you must have a paid subscription to Slack, then you can be invited via Slack Connect - please open an issue in this repo and we'll request the relevant details to invite you.)

If you'd like to help draft content for Bluesky, LinkedIn or Twitter/X, please sign up at Typefully.com and request an invite to the GraphQL Foundation's Typefully account via operations at graphql dot org.

## Posting frequency

There are 4 posting slots every day, 2 for US times, 2 for EU times, based on what we found worked best. Avoid Fridays if possible as the engagement is lower.

We generally aim to do 3-5 posts/channel/week to keep our audience engaged while not spamming it. That's roughly one post every week day.

## Tone of voice

Our main goal is to create discussions about the GraphQL language and connect users, contributors and the community at large.

Hot takes are allowed, but trolling and clickbait content are discouraged.

Boosting other community members' posts or content is encouraged as that increases the network effect. That said, no community member or vendor should receive disproportionate attention; the GraphQL Foundation is a vendor neutral organization and endeavors to promote different organizations and individuals fairly.

## Example content

- New releases: "graphql-js 17 is out with fragment arguments, try it out!"
- Poll: "What GraphQL client are you using?"
- Event: "Grab your ticket for GraphQLConf!"
- Community blog post: "Read from Benjie about error handling in GraphQL."
- etc...
