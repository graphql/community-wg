# GraphQL Social Media

GraphQL is present on:

- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/graphql)
- [BlueSky](https://bsky.app/profile/graphql.org)
- [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/graphql-foundation/)
- [YouTube]()

The community manages the publications through [Typefully](https://typefully.com/) (with a current experimentation with [Buffer](https://buffer.com/)).

## Contributing 

If you want to contribute content, please share ideas and links in the `#social-media` slack channel. If you are not on that channel yet, please open an issue in this repo and we'll invite you.

If you want to help posting content, we can invite you to the Typefully account. Access is granted on a per-need basis, and decided by the current social media team. 

## Posting frequency

There are 4 posting slots every day, 2 for US times, 2 for EU times, based on what we found worked best. Avoid Fridays if possible as the engagement is lower.

We generally aim to do 3-5 posts/week to keep our audience engaged while not spamming it.

## Tone of voice

Our main goal is to create discussions about the GraphQL language and connect users, contributors and the community at large.

Hot takes are allowed, but trolling and clickbait content are discouraged.

Quoting/retweeting other community members is strongly encouraged as that increases the network effect. 

## Example content

- New releases: "graphql-js 17 is out with fragment arguments, try it out!"
- Poll: "What GraphQL client are you using?"
- Event: "Grab your ticket for GraphQLConf!"
- Community blog post: "Read from Benjie about error handling in GraphQL."
- etc...
